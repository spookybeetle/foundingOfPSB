        <p n="1">Dear <persName pers="Irvin Kochel">Mr. Kochel</persName>: Your letter to <persName
                pers="Mary Behrend">Mrs. Behrend</persName> with which you enclosed the bill from
                <persName pers="Henry Althof">Henry Althof</persName>'s Sons Company for <dolAmount
                curency="USD">$148.00</dolAmount> covering the furnishing and installing of an iron
            railing around the Niagara display case arrived sometime ago. I forwarded the letter to
                <persName pers="Mary Behrend">Mrs. Behrend</persName> and held the bill here
            awaiting her reply. We have Just had a letter from <persName pers="Mary Behrend">Mrs.
                Behrend</persName> asking that we make out a check and send it on to you so that you
            could present it to <persName>Mr. Althof</persName>.</p>
        <p n="2">In <persName pers="Mary Behrend">Mrs. Behrend</persName>'s letter she asked that
            you have a picture taken of the boat and rail and send it to her as she is interested to
            know how it looks now. She said there is no rush about this--that it could be done when
            the students have returned for the fall term.</p>
        <p n="3">From what we hear from <persName pers="Mary Behrend">Mrs, Behrend</persName> and
                <persName>Miss Wild</persName> they are having a lovely trip. They expect to return
