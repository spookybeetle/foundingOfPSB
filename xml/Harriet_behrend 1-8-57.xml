        Dear Mr. Kochel:
        I was very interested to see the orogram for
        the Christmas ceremony at Behrend Center.
        I
        am looking forward to being in Erie in June,
        at which time I hone to have my two sons with
        me.
        I do hope you will be there, as I would
        like to bring
        them to Behrend Center and
        have them meet you.
        With best wishes for the New Year, I am
        Sincerely yours,
        Harriet Sayre
        Harriet Behrend Sayre.
