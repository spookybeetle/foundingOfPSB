        <p n="1">Dear <persName pers="#IHK">Mr. Kochel</persName>: Your letter to <persName
                pers="#MB">Mrs. Behrend</persName> with which you enclosed the bill from
                <persName pers="#HAA">Henry Althof</persName>'s Sons Company for <dolAmount
                curency="USD">$148.00</dolAmount> covering the furnishing and installing of an iron
            railing around the Niagara display case arrived sometime ago. I forwarded the letter to
                <persName pers="#MB">Mrs. Behrend</persName> and held the bill here
            awaiting her reply. We have Just had a letter from <persName pers="#MB">Mrs.
                Behrend</persName> asking that we make out a check and send it on to you so that you
            could present it to <persName pers = "#HAA">Mr. Althof</persName>.</p>
        <p n="2">In <persName pers="#MB">Mrs. Behrend</persName>'s letter she asked that
            you have a picture taken of the boat and rail and send it to her as she is interested to
            know how it looks now. She said there is no rush about this--that it could be done when
            the students have returned for the fall term.</p>
        <p n="3">From what we hear from <persName pers="#MB">Mrs, Behrend</persName> and
                <persName pers="#Unknown">Miss Wild</persName> they are having a lovely trip. They expect to return
            to <location>Greenwich</location> about the middle of <time type="Month"
                >September</time>.</p>
        <closing>Sincerely yours, <signature style="handwriting" ink="black"><persName pers="#Unknown">Elizabeth A.
