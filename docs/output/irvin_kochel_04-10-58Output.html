                  <span class="num">0</span>21 West Putnam<br/>

               <p><span class="num">1</span>Dear <a class="pers" href="advisory_board_xx-xx-57Output.html#MB">Mrs. Behrend</a>: I hope you will forgive my tardiness in replying o your most recent communica- tion.
                  I very much enjoyed the card you sent from Hawaii, particularly since it arrived during a long snowy winter in Erie. It was wonderful to view the surf and sunshine indicated in the picture. It gave
                  me real hope that Spring and Summer would eventually arrive.</p>
               
               <p><span class="num">2</span>We have all been very busy here at Behrend Center working on some long range plans for development and growth, which I know when completed
                  you will be very much interested in seeing. The picture is very encouraging when we
                  view it over a ten year period. Considering the growth in population in the Erie area and the increased birth rate, we have good reason to believe that the next ten
                  years may show an increase in our student body to as many as a thousand students.
                  This growth is predicated on the hope that we will be able to build several dormitories
                  on the Behrend campus.</p>
               
               <p><span class="num">3</span>You will be interested to know that the University is planning to build a sewage disposal
                  plant, financed by University funds. This plant is a necessity to us if we are going
                  to prepare for future growth. We do not plan to spend any of <a class="pers" href="advisory_board_xx-xx-57Output.html#Unknown">Dr. Otto Behrend</a>'s bequest for maintenance but rather would hope to use it for the construction of
                  new classrooms and laboratory facilities. I know that the Uni- versity will respect
                  the wishes of our local Advisory Board and they certainly are very much in favor of
                  utilizing this money for expansion purposes rather than maintenance.</p>
               
               <p><span class="num">4</span>We have at the present time 223 students enrolled and a very encouraging note may
                  be found in the fact that we have as of this date received admissions for 2/3 of the
                  Freshman class as compared to last year's entering Freshman class. Me have had beautiful
                  weather in Erie the past few weeks and the students are get- ting eager to clean out the swimming pool and prepare it for use before they leave for their summer vacation. Actually, there are only six more weeks of school re- maining before the end of
                  May when t he students ill be leaving for their summer vacation.</p>
               
               <p><span class="num">5</span>I had a very nice note from <a class="pers" href="advisory_board_xx-xx-57Output.html#Unknown">Miss Wild</a> and <a class="pers" href="advisory_board_xx-xx-57Output.html#Unknown">Mrs. Sayre</a>, indicating that they plan to be in Erie in June to play in a golf tournament. I expect this is probably the women's western open
                  golf tournament to be held at the Kahka Club
                  June 19-20-21, I am looking forvard to seeing them at that time. <a class="pers" href="advisory_board_xx-xx-57Output.html#Unknown">Mrs. Sayre</a> also indicated she planned to bring her sons along on this trip and am very anxious
                  to meet them.</p>
               
               
               <p><span class="num">6</span><a class="pers" href="advisory_board_xx-xx-57Output.html#Unknown">Mrs. Kochel</a> and the children are all well, although during March we had a case of measles which vas contracted by all three children. <a class="pers" href="advisory_board_xx-xx-57Output.html#Unknown">Jeffrey</a>, our oldest song is in third grade now and getting to be quite a young man. <a class="pers" href="advisory_board_xx-xx-57Output.html#Unknown">Patty</a> has been going to kindergarten this year and <a class="pers" href="advisory_board_xx-xx-57Output.html#Unknown">Irvin, the III</a>, our youngest who is now 4 years old, is of course still at home and growing like
                  a weed.</p>
