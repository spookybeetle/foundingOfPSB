                     <persName>Mrs. Behrend</persName>:</recipient>
                  
                  
                  <p n="1">I hope you will forgive my tardiness in replying o your most recent communica-
                     tion. I very much enjoyed the card you sent from 
                     <location type="state">Hawaii</location>, particularly since it arrived during a long snowy winter in
                     
                     <location type="city">Erie</location>. It was wonderful to view the surf and
                     sunshine indicated in the picture. It gave me real hope that <time type="month">Spring</time> and <time type="season">Summer</time> would eventually
                     arrive.</p>
                  
                  <p n="2">We have all been very busy here at 
                     <name type="location">Behrend Center</name>
                     working on some long range plans for development and growth, which I know when
                     completed you will be very much interested in seeing. The picture is very
                     encouraging when we view it over a ten year period. Considering the growth in
                     population in the 
                     <location type="city">Erie</location> area and the increased birth
                     rate, we have good reason to believe that the next ten years may show an increase
                     in
                     our student body to as many as a thousand students. This growth is predicated on the
                     hope that we will be able to build several dormitories on the 
                     <name type="location">Behrend campus</name>.</p>
                  
                  <p n="3">You will be interested to know that the University is planning to build a
                     sewage disposal plant, financed by University funds. This plant is a necessity to
                     us
                     if we are going to prepare for future growth. We do not plan to spend any of
                     
                     <persName type="Otto Behrend">Dr. Otto Behrend</persName>'s bequest for
                     maintenance but rather would hope to use it for the construction of new classrooms
                     and laboratory facilities. I know that the Uni- versity will respect the wishes of
                     our local Advisory Board and they certainly are very much in favor of utilizing this
                     money for expansion purposes rather than maintenance.</p>
                  
                  <p n="4">We have at the present time 
                     <num>223 students</num> enrolled and a very
                     encouraging note may be found in the fact that we have as of this date received
                     admissions for 2/3 of the Freshman class as compared to last year's entering
                     Freshman class. Me have had beautiful weather in 
                     <location type="city">Erie</location> the past few weeks and the students are get- ting eager to
                     clean out the 
                     <location type="object">swimming pool</location> and prepare it for
                     use before they leave for their <time type="season">summer vacation</time>.
                     Actually, there are only six more weeks of school re- maining before the end of May
                     when t he students ill be leaving for their <time type="season">summer
                        vacation</time>.</p>
                  
                  <p n="5">I had a very nice note from 
                     <persName>Miss Wild</persName> and 
                     <persName>Mrs.
                        Sayre</persName>, indicating that they plan to be in 
                     <location type="city">Erie</location> in <time type="season">June</time> to play in a golf
                     tournament. I expect this is probably the women's western open golf tournament to
                     be
                     held at the 
                     <org>Kahka Club</org>
                     <time type="month day">June 19-20-21</time>, I am looking forvard to seeing them at
                     that time. 
                     <persName>Mrs. Sayre</persName> also indicated she planned to bring her
                     sons along on this trip and am very anxious to meet them.</p>
