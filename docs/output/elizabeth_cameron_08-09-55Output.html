                  <a class="pers" href="advisory_board_xx-xx-57Output.html#HAA">Henry Althof</a>'s Sons Company for $148.00 covering the furnishing and installing of an iron
                  railing around the Niagara display case arrived sometime ago. I forwarded the letter
                  to
                  <a class="pers" href="advisory_board_xx-xx-57Output.html#MB">Mrs. Behrend</a> and held the bill here
                  awaiting her reply. We have Just had a letter from <a class="pers" href="advisory_board_xx-xx-57Output.html#MB">Mrs.
                     Behrend</a> asking that we make out a check and send it on to you so that you

                  you have a picture taken of the boat and rail and send it to her as she is interested
                  to
                  know how it looks now. She said there is no rush about this--that it could be done
                  when
                  the students have returned for the fall term.</p>
