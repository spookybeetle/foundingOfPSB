         Mr. Irvin Kochel
         Behrend Center
         Pennsylvania State College Erie,
         Pennsylvania
         
         Dear Mr. Kochel: Your letter to Mrs. Behrend with which you enclosed the bill from
         Henry Althof's Sons Company for $148.00 covering the furnishing and installing of an iron
         railing around the Niagara display case arrived sometime ago. I forwarded the letter
         to
         Mrs. Behrend and held the bill here
         awaiting her reply. We have Just had a letter from Mrs.
         Behrend asking that we make out a check and send it on to you so that you
         could present it to Mr. Althof.
         In Mrs. Behrend's letter she asked that
         you have a picture taken of the boat and rail and send it to her as she is interested
         to
         know how it looks now. She said there is no rush about this--that it could be done
         when
         the students have returned for the fall term.
         From what we hear from Mrs, Behrend and
         Miss Wild they are having a lovely trip. They expect to return
         to Greenwich about the middle of September.
         Sincerely yours, Elizabeth A.
         Cameron For Mrs.
         Behrend
         eac. enc.
         
         Tom! Send with love letter
         althuf. Thanks Sir
